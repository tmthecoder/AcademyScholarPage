# academy_scholar_page

A project I put together for the video I recorded as part of my MCST Academy Scholar application

## Under the Hood

The animation (scrollable) is all there is to the project.

The animation code is actually similar to the one used in cClip's homepage animation (https://cclip.app)

Pretty cool, right?
